# Heart UCI Dataset-Kaggle
* This dataset have 76 attributes which are contains the records the age,sex, chest pain type,cholestrol and other important information.
## Getting Started
* First Download the Dataset from the link given in the Data Sources.
* Clone the repo 
* Go to the File and run the .py file through cmd with python3 as the default python version.

## How Things Are Working
* First we had cleaned the dataset and deleted some of the columns from the dataset so that we can filter the important vs unimportant.
* Changed the name of the Columns according to the Dataset we had got.
### Technologies:
* Programming Language: Python3
* Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Visualization:Plotly and Numpy

### Data Sources:
Datasets used for the analysis can be found on the given [link](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci), in the given link you can download here.
### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
